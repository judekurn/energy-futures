# energy-futures
Am I supposed to write something here?
The purpose of this study is to produce scenarios for energy futures for Canada. Understanding the future scenarios is important for devising plans to achieve desirable and avoid disastrous outcomes. However, most scenario research conducted at national levels tend to have a narrow focus. That means scenarios are developed based on the examination of limited scenario variables, which influence the future within the country and are specific to the energy sector alone (i.e. looking at only one scale). For this research, I am using a new method to develop energy scenarios that considers multiple scales.
